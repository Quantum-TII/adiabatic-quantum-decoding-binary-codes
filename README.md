# Solving linear and nonlinear codes using adiabatic evolution

(currently in progress)

This repository contains code to solve instances of nonlinear codes using the simulator Qibo and allows it to be run on dwave devices.

As of right now, only the example with 3 bits can be properly run, as the one with 8 has a problem when scaling down the interaction to two body.
